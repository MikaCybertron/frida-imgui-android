# Frida Android IMGUI

## Work in progress

This is a work in progress project to create a simple IMGUI for Android using Frida.

## Build IMGUI

You must have the Android NDK installed and set up the PATH in the `build.sh` script.

```bash
./build.sh
```

## How to use

Place the `libimgui.so` in `/data/local/tmp/` and you are ready to go.

You can resolve all the symbols using the utilities functions in the script and call the functions directly.
